To follow along with the workshop exercises, you'll need Quarto version 1.8+ and access to a code editor that supports R.

While Quarto itself doesn't require a programming language, the exercises will include code chunks in R. If you don’t already have R set up locally, I recommend using Posit Cloud. I will delete the Posit Cloud project in a few days, so please make a copy of your materials if you would like to keep them.

### Recommended Setup Options

#### Option 1: Posit Cloud (RStudio in the cloud)

* Create a free account at <https://posit.cloud>
* Open the Posit Cloud project link: <https://posit.cloud/content/11332810>

#### Option 2: Local Installation
