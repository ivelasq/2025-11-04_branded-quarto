* Add an `important` callout box to "Key Findings at a Glance":

```markdown
::: {.callout-important}
_text here_
:::
```

* Change the `format` to `revealjs`. Preview the document.
* Change the `format` to `typst`. Preview the document.

::: {.callout-note}
Removing `code-fold`, `code-summary`, and `embed-resources` is not required because these are `html` only features. However, I'd recommend removing them to keep your document tidy.
