If you're using RStudio, you'll find the option under the \"File\" menu. For those of you using VS Code or Positron, the command palette is the fastest way to get started. Once you've created the file, make sure to save it as _brand.yml in the root directory of your project.\n:::\n\n## **brand.yml** Inspiration\n\nThe **brand.yml** docs site has a great Inspiration page with many references!\n\n[![](images/brand-inspiration.png){width=40% fig-align=\"center\"}](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/inspiration/){preview-link=\"true\"}\n\n::: footer\nLearn more: [Inspiration](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/inspiration/)\n:::\n\n::: notes\nWhen you're ready to start building your brand file, you don't have to start from scratch. The brand.yml documentation site has an entire page dedicated to inspiration. The inspiration page is full of examples from real-world projects, which can give you a great starting point for your own branding. I highly recommend checking it out for ideas on colors, fonts, and layouts.\n:::\n\n## Get a little help from a Large Language Model (LLM)\n\n[![](images/brand-llm.png){width=40% fig-align=\"center\"}](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/articles/llm-brand-yml-prompt/){preview-link=\"true\"}\n\n::: footer\nLearn more: [Creating a brand.yml with an LLM](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/articles/llm-brand-yml-prompt/)\n:::\n\n::: notes\nFor those of you who want to jumpstart the process even more, you can use a Large Language Model, or LLM, to help you. The brand.yml docs site has a fantastic guide with prompts you can use to generate a starter brand.yml file. You can ask an LLM like ChatGPT or Claude to create a brand.yml file for you, describing the look and feel you want. This can save a lot of time and help you get a solid foundation very quickly.\n:::\n\n# Sharing your brand {background-color='{{< brand color dark-blue >}}'}\n\n::: notes\nSo you've created your _brand.yml file, and you love it. Now, how do you share it with your team or use it across multiple projects?\n:::\n\n## Using a shared drive\n\n- Shared repository (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.)\n- GitHub repo allows you to share with version control\n\n::: notes\nThe simplest way is to share the file directly. You can use a shared repository like Google Drive or OneDrive. However, a more robust solution, especially if you're working with a team, is to use a GitHub repo. By storing your _brand.yml file in a GitHub repo, you get all the benefits of version control. This means you can track changes, revert to previous versions if needed.\n:::\n\n## Creating a Brand Extension\n\nNew in Quarto 1.8, you can create a Quarto extension that provides a **brand.yml** file and assets.\n\nGet started by running the below:\n\n```{.bash filename=\"Terminal\"}\n$ quarto create extension brand\n ? Extension Name › my-brand\n```\n\n<br>\n\n::: callout-important\nBrand Extensions must be used with a `_quarto.yml` project.\n:::\n\n::: footer\nLearn more: [Brand Extensions](https://prerelease.quarto.org/docs/extensions/brand.html)\n:::\n\n::: notes\nNow, here's where it gets really powerful. As of Quarto 1.8, you can package your _brand.yml file and all its assets, like images and CSS, into a Quarto extension. The command line code shown on the slide walks you through the first step of creating a brand extension from the terminal. It's important to note that Brand Extensions must be used within a Quarto project that has its own _quarto.yml file.\n:::\n\n## Contents of a Brand Extension\n\n```bash\n? Extension Name › my-brand\nCreating extension at /{...}/my-brand:\n  - Created _quarto.yml\n  - Created README.md\n  - Created _extensions/my-brand/brand.yml\n  - Created _extensions/my-brand/_extension.yml\n  - Created .gitignore\n  - Created example.qmd\n? Open With\n❯ positron\n  vscode\n  rstudio\n  (don't open)\n```\n\n::: notes\nWhen you create a brand extension, Quarto generates a directory with some key files.\n:::\n\n## Contents of a Brand Extension\n\n```{.markdown filename=\"_extensions/my-brand/_extension.yml\"}\ntitle: My-brand\nauthor: Gordon Woodhull\nversion: 1.0.0\nquarto-required: \">=99.9.0\"\ncontributes:\n  metadata:\n    project:\n      brand: brand.yml\n```\n\n::: notes\nOne important one is the _extension.yml file, which acts as the manifest for your extension. The code on the slide shows a simple _extension.yml file. The contributes section is what makes this a brand extension. It tells Quarto that this extension provides a brand.yml file.\n:::\n\n## Contents of a Brand Extension\n\n```{.markdown filename=\"_extensions/mybrand/brand.yml\"}\ncolor:\n  background:\n    light: \"#fff\"\n    dark: \"#000\"\n  foreground:\n    light: \"#000\"\n    dark: \"#fff\"\n```\n\n::: notes\nWithin the created _brand.yml file, you can start building your brand. It provides just the most basic code to enable light and dark mode.\n:::\n\n## Sharing the Brand Extension\n\nPublish your Brand Extension to a GitHub repository. Once it's on GitHub, anyone can add it to their Quarto project.\n\nRun the following command in the Quarto project to use the extension:\n\n```{.bash filename=\"Terminal\"}\nquarto add <github-organization>/<your-brand-name>\n```\n\n## Updating the Brand Extension\n\nIf you make changes to your Brand Extension on GitHub, users can update the extension in their projects by running this command:\n\n```{.bash filename=\"Terminal\"}\nquarto update <github-organization>/<your-brand-name>\n```\n\n## Our turn {background-color='{{< brand color light-blue >}}' .smaller}\n\nLet's create a new Brand Extension.\n\n  * Open your Terminal and run: `quarto create extension brand`\n  * Read about how to prompt a large language model (LLM) to create a _brand.yml file: [posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/articles/llm-brand-yml-prompt](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/articles/llm-brand-yml-prompt)\n  * Customize the default `_extensions/mybrand/brand.yml` file. Take note of how well the output incorporates your brand and what, if any, elements are missing or need to be adjusted.\n    * Preview by running `quarto preview example.qmd` in the Terminal.\n\nWe'd love for you to add your new **brand.yml** file to the Inspiration page! You can see examples and contribute your own by visiting the following links:\n\n* Inspiration page: [posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/inspiration](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/inspiration/)\n* Submit a PR: [github.com/posit-dev/brand-yml/issues](https://github.com/posit-dev/brand-yml/issues)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"countdown\" id=\"timer_eacaa43b\" data-update-every=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" style=\"right:0;bottom:0;\">\n<div class=\"countdown-controls\"><button class=\"countdown-bump-down\">&minus;</button><button class=\"countdown-bump-up\">&plus;</button></div>\n<code class=\"countdown-time\"><span class=\"countdown-digits minutes\">05</span><span class=\"countdown-digits colon\">:</span><span class=\"countdown-digits seconds\">00</span></code>\n</div>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: notes\nAnd with that, it's time for you to give it a try! We're going to take a few minutes to walk through creating your own _brand.yml file.\n:::",
