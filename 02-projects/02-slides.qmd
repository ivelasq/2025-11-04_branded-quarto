## Quarto projects

Quarto projects are directories that provide:

::: incremental

* A way to render all or some of the files in a directory with a single command (e.g. `quarto render myproject`).
* A way to share YAML configuration across multiple documents.
* The ability to redirect output artifacts to another directory.
* The ability to freeze rendered output (i.e. don’t re-execute documents unless they have changed).

:::

::: notes
One of the most important features of Quarto Projects is the ability to share YAML metadata options across multiple documents.

## Quarto projects

Some formats must be created within a Quarto project:

* Websites
* Blogs
* Books

::: columns
::: {.column .fragment .fade-right width="50%"}
This is a Quarto Project.

```         
my-folder/
├── _quarto.yml
├── my-document.ipynb
```
:::

::: {.column .fragment .fade-left width="50%"}
This is not.

```         
my-folder/
├── my-document.ipynb
```

::: notes
Quarto projects include a \_quarto.yml configuration file so that every document in the project inherits the metadata in that file. So, if you think about a blog, you probably want all your posts to have the same theme. If you use the Quarto command for making a new blog, it will automatically be a project, and you can configure the theme for all pages in the \_quarto.yml file.

## \_quarto.yml {auto-animate="true"}

A YAML file with particular keys and values that Quarto recognizes. Unrecognized keys are ignored.

## Freeze

You can use the freeze option to denote that computational documents should never be re-rendered during a global project render, or alternatively only be re-rendered when their source file changes:

``` {.yaml .fragment filename="_quarto.yml"}
execute:
  freeze: true  # never re-render during project render
```

<br>

``` {.yaml .fragment filename="_quarto.yml"}
execute:
  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes
```

::: notes
Rendering a bunch of files can be quite time consuming depending on the computations required. The freeze option specifies if computational documents should never be re-rendered during a global project render, or only be re-rendered when their source file changes. Freeze can used when you have either a large number of collaborators or many computational documents created over a long period of time. In these cases, it can be challenging to fully re-execute every document when you render the site. This could be because some documents have environment-specific requirements or one of your teammates wrote something in Python, which you don't have installed. Using freeze ensures that you can always reproducibly render your site.
